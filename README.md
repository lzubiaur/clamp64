Hi, 

This is [my entry](https://lzubiaur.itch.io/clamp-64) for the 2017 [#LOWREZJAM](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2017) game jam.

The game was [ranked 26th](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2017/results?page=3) out of 233 games! :)

The gameplay is a tribute to the 80s classic like [Qix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix) or [Jezzball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JezzBall). Windows or OSX binaries are available [here](https://lzubiaur.itch.io/clamp-64).
